Low code platform for rapid development of Spring Boot applications.

# Background
Traditionally developing an enterprise application has been a tedious and time-consuming endeavor. After gathering the requirements, a tremendous amount of time is spent by the development team in implementing each and every piece of the software being developed. Besides development, they have to actively engage in the maintenance and bug fixing process; the latter taking a hefty amount of the project time. Often, the project has to be adapted to suit the newer requirements or the ones that changed. As the project evolves, the technical debt increases, the source code starts looking diverse with each feature having its own flavor and style in which it was implemented. In many cases, you need to have special skills to understand these diversely written pieces and add enhancements or fix issues. This overall process puts a lot of pressure on the development team and makes it very difficult for the software to evolve in a consistent manner. 

Project **Ladu** is an effort to solve some of the problems that are highlighted above. It is a **Low-code platform** that provides a model definition language and code generation facility. The generated code is industry standard and is of very high quality. In the current state, it can generate a fully-functional **Spring Boot** microservice application and **Vue.js** Components within minutes. It provides support for easily adding validations to the generated Vue components. The same can be used as-is in a Vue project created using Vue CLI. The amount of repetitive Spring Boot code (Entities, Controllers, Repositories, Services...) that the user has to manually code is reduced to none. 

Automatic generation of the Schema for multiple databases is supported by the platform. Unit-tests and UI automation scripts are generated as part of the process. 

Managing changes or adding new features using the platform is a no brainer. The user has to modify the entity definition and generated code (Spring Boot, Vue, Unit-tests, Automation scripts, Database schema) are adapted appropriately. The amount of manual intervention is very low.

Most importantly, the platform greatly reduces the amount of exposure to the technology that you would have had with the traditional approach. The rapid Code generation and Change management facility can help you deliver very high-quality projects at a faster pace. Realistically speaking, the overall cost of the project can be reduced by at least 40%.
