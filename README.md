Low code platform for rapid development of Spring Boot applications.

# Background
Developing a Spring Boot application involves defining multiple Entities, Controllers, Services, Repositories, Main Application...etc. Every time you define a new Entity, you are expected to define a new Controller, Repository, and Service. The process keeps on repeating throughout the lifecycle of the project as it grows. 

At least 15% of your project time is spent doing the above repetitive work. In addition, you have to define the database schemas, unit-tests...etc which adds 5% to the overall time spend. Defining the UI takes up at least 25% of the project time. As the requirement change (which very often happens in a real-world project), you have to alter all the above pieces that you had so carefully crafted. Change management takes a hefty amount of time. In the process, you introduce bugs, and fixing them takes time. 

The problem with the above software development approach is that a lot of valuable time is spent doing repetitive unproductive tasks. Also, exposure to technology is quite high - you are expected to know a programming language, frameworks like Spring Boot/Quarks, knowledge of UI frameworks, Databases...etc. The amount of pressure it puts on a developer is very high.

What if “all” the above-mentioned artifacts are generated for you? You define an **Entity** and a complete Spring Boot application along with a functional UI component is generated? The unit-tests, the UI automation scripts, the Database schema is generated?

The above is precisely what **Ladu** does for you. It is a **Low Code platform** that provides a entity definition language based on which it generates a fully-functional Spring Boot microservices application, UI components based on Vue.js (with validation support), Database schemas for multiple databases, unit-tests, automation tests in no time. Changement management is handled by the platform with very little manual intervention. The generated code is of very high quality.
